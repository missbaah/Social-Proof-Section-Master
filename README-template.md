## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To achieve the solution I came to here are some new things I learnt as a beginner especially in writing css.

- I learnt how to design mobile first by creating a container with the width displayed in the style guide a

- Line height can be used to adjust the spacing between text for a better effect. Some fonts are closed together so learning about line height was great. Letter spacing is also great for spacing the individual characters in the font.

- Background-postion has been helpful in postioning the two background images needed for challenges

- I discovered the webkit scrollbar can be hidden using the webkit pseudo class element and setting the element to display none

- I discovered the how to make the background images responsive by making setting media screens for mobile and desktop widths. 


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
